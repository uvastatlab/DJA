## The Normal Distribution

The Normal Distribution is basically a curve that looks like a bell. Here's a picture.

```{r}
curve(dnorm(x), from = -3, to = 3, ylab = "")
```

## The Normal Distribution

The mean is the top of the hump (red line). The standard deviation is the _inflection point_, where the curve goes from _concave down_ to _concave up_ (blue lines). It measures spread. Below we see the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1.

```{r}
curve(dnorm(x), from = -3, to = 3, ylab = "")
abline(v = 0, col = "red")
abline(v = 1, col = "blue")
abline(v = -1, col = "blue")
```

## The Normal Distribution

The mean and standard deviation are like dials or controls on a machine. Changing the mean moves the curve _left and right_. Changing the standard deviation makes the curve _skinny or wide_.

```{r}
op <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
curve(dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1), from = -6, to = 6, ylab = "", main = "mean = 0; sd = 1", ylim = c(0,0.4))
curve(dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 2), from = -6, to = 6, ylab = "", main = "mean = 0; sd = 2", ylim = c(0,0.4))
curve(dnorm(x, mean = 2, sd = 1), from = -6, to = 6, ylab = "", main = "mean = 2; sd = 1", ylim = c(0,0.4))
curve(dnorm(x, mean = 2, sd = 2), from = -6, to = 6, ylab = "", main = "mean = 2; sd = 2", ylim = c(0,0.4))
par(op)
```

## The Normal Distribution

Since the mean and standard deviation completely determine the shape of the curve, we call them _parameters_. Statisticians use the Greek symbols $\mu$ (mu) to represent the mean and $\sigma$ (sigma) to represent the standard deviation. 

Here's the formula to draw the line from the Normal distribution [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution). There is nothing "Normal" about it! It looks pretty terrible! Fortunately, unless you teach a statistics class, you don't need to remember it.

## The Normal Distribution is a probability distribution

Calling the Normal distribution a _probability distribution_ means the area under the curve is equal to 1, or 100%. 


## Why do we care about the Normal distribution?

Take a look at this histogram of the heights of 250 randomly sampled US males. Most people are between 65 and 75 inches tall. Does the shape look familiar?

```{r}
set.seed(1)
heights <- rnorm(n = 250, mean = 69, sd = 3)
hist(heights, freq = FALSE)
```

## The Normal distribution is a good approximation 

If we take the mean and standard deviation of our data sample, we can use those values as parameters in a Normal distribution and draw a smooth curve to _approximate_ the distribution.


```{r}
hist(heights, freq = FALSE)
curve(dnorm(x, mean = mean(heights), sd = sd(heights)), 
      from = 60, to = 80, add = TRUE)

```

## Using the Normal distribution

Now we can use the Normal distribution to answer questions such as "what is the probability a randomly selected US male is taller than 6 feet 4 inches (76 inches)?" That's the area under the curve to the right of 76 inches. Here's a crude illustration.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(mosaic)
plotDist("norm", mean = mean(heights), sd = sd(heights), 
         groups = x > 76, type="h", col=c("wheat1", "blue"))

```


## Using the Normal distribution

R makes is pretty easy to find the area under the normal curve with the `pnorm()` function. By default it finds area to the _left_ of the value you give it. To go to the right, specify `lower.tail = FALSE`. Notice we use the `mean()` and `sd()` functions to find the mean and standard deviation of our data.

```{r echo=TRUE}
pnorm(76, mean = mean(heights), sd = sd(heights), lower.tail = FALSE)
```

0.008 rounds to about 0.01, or 0.01 $\times$ 100 = 1%. It appears there's about a 1% chance (1 in 100) that a randomly selected US male will be taller than 6 feet 4 inches.

## Simulating data from a Normal distribution

I didn't really sample 250 US males and measure their heights? Instead I randomly sampled values from a Normal distribution with mean 69 inches and standard deviation 3 inches. I did that in R using the `rnorm()` function as follows. (The `set.seed(1)` code ensures you and I generate the same "random" data. Change the 1 to another positive integer and you'll get another random set of data.)

```{r echo=TRUE}
set.seed(1)
heights <- rnorm(n = 250, mean = 69, sd = 3)
```
