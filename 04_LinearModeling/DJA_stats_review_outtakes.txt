## Distribution of Statistics

The previous example was a bit contrived. Raw data is never truly Normally distributed, nor is it necessary.

The reason we care about the Normal distribution is that the _sampling distribution of means_ is approximately Normal. 

## Thought experiment

1. randomly sample data from a population
2. calculate the mean
3. repeat steps 2 and 3 many times (like millions) and save all the means

The distribution of the means will be approximately Normal, virtually no matter the distribution of the population.

## Quick demo

This "population" is not Normal. It is Uniform. `runif()` draws random values from a uniform distribution. Every value from `min` to `max` is equally likely. 

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=4}
x <- runif(n = 1e6, min = 1, max = 10)
hist(x)
```

## Quick demo

Take 1000 samples of size 30 from the uniform population, take the mean of each sample, and plot distribution. The `replicate()` and `sample()` functions make this pretty easy. The sampling distribution of the means is approximately Normal.

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=4}
means <- replicate(n = 1000, mean(sample(x, 30, replace = TRUE)))
hist(means)
```

## Standard error & confidence intervals

The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is called the _standard error_.

Adding and subtracting about 2 standard errors from the mean gives a _confidence interval_.

A confidence interval gives some indication of how uncertain our estimate is. Here we take a single sample of size 30 from our uniform population and use the `t.test()` function to get a 95% confidence interval. The `$conf.int` part extracts the confidence interval.

```{r echo=TRUE}
sx <- sample(x, size = 30, replace = TRUE)
t.test(sx)$conf.int
```
